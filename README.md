This is a web-based app built using streamlit while implementing Lanchain's different components, OpenAI models, and using Pinecone as the vectorstore.

There are several .py files that are all used for developing both the front-end (htmlTemp.py and main.py) and backend (core.py and ingestion.py), a .env file that contains the API keys from OpenAI and Pinecone platform, and a .txt file that lists down the frameworks and dependencies to run the code. 

The my_doc folder contains sample PDF files that we can use to test the app.
